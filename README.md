#  üè† $HOME üè†

Here are my standalone [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) configuration files that are used on my NixOS systems and also other clients linux distribution systems.

This allows for home directory portability from machine to machine to configure once and enjoy a many times forward. If you are looking for _system_ configuration have a peek at my [NixOS Configurations](https://github.com/tiredofit/nixos-config)

If you would like to base your own configuration from this, you will need to be able to use [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

**Highlights**:

- Flexible **roles** such as **workstation**, **server**, **kiosk**
- Deployment of secrets using **sops-nix**
- Highly configured desktop environments for **i3** **sway** and **hyprland**
- Some real interesting **bash scripts** for automating common tasks.
- **Declarative** **themes** and **wallpapers** with **nix-colors**

- I sort of blew the summer of 2023 moving into this configuration after waving a fond farewell to near 2 decades of running Arch Linux. This, as with life, is still WIP. I documented the process on the [Tired of IT! NixOS](https://notes.tiredofit.ca/books/linux/chapter/nixos) chapter on my website.

## Tree Structure

- `flake.nix`: Entrypoint for home configurations.
- `dotfiles`: Configuration files that are outside of the Home-Manager configuration (not migrated to nix)
- `features`: Configurations of various packages available in the nix / home-manager ecosystem.
  - `cli`: Command line tools
  - `gui`: Graphical applications and fonts
    - `desktop`: Desktop / Window Manager environments
  - `services`: Services that are useful
  - `themes`: Color themes
- `home`: Home Manager Configurations, accessible via `home-manager switch --flake `.
  - Split in between 'orgs' and common configuration this creates isolation. Based on 'roles' defaults are loaded
    and then each subfolder creates a different level of configuration specific to that host or role.
    - `common`: Shared configurations consumed by all users.
      - `secrets`: Secrets that are available to all users
    - `toi`: The 'toi' org to allow for isolation of configurations, secrets and config from various clients
      - `secrets`: Secrets that are specific to the 'toi' org
      - `<host>`: Optional subfolder to load more configuration files based on the home-manager profiles name
    - `sd`: Similar to the above org, just another org for isolation
- `modules`: Modules that are specific to this installation

## Usage

I used option `3` (Standalone) of the  [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) installation guide. I documented it on my website here: [Tired of I.T! Home Manager Setup](https://notes.tiredofit.ca/books/linux/page/home-manager-setup). The quick steps were:

- Add Home Manager Channel

```
nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/release-23.05.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update
```

- Logout and log back in to install

```
nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

- This will create a default configuration flie at `~/.config/home-manager/home.nix`. Lets get rid of it and clone this repository instead.

```
rm -rf ~/.config/home-manager
git clone https://github.com/tiredofit/dotfiles.git ~/.config/home-manager
```

- Activate the configuration

```
home-manager switch --flake ~/.config/home-manager/#<config> -v
```

### Keep it up to date

```
nix flake update ~/.config/home-manager
```

### Managing Secrets

I document the process of getting encrypted secrets created and keeping up to date on my website. [Tired of IT! Secrets Management](https://notes.tiredofit.ca/books/linux/page/secrets-management).

Do you what you'd like and I hope that this inspires you for your own configurations as many others have myself.
